# GPCC Work
For my second co-op I worked as a Web Designer at the Greater Philadelphia Chamber of Commerce (the Chamber). The HTML files in this repository are examples of the work that I completed during my time there. I was a part of a newsletter redesign project that is still underway and will be posted upon its launch. 

My primary responsibilities were the HTML publications of the Chamber but I also worked on publications for the Young Professionals Network, Select Greater Philadelphia, Philadelphia Alliance for Capital and Technologies, Chilean American Chamber of Commerce, and British American Business Council.
